# Comparative Analysis of CNN and Vision Transformer for Emotion Detection in Facial Expressions

**Dataset Description:** The RAF-DB (Real-world Affective Face Database) is a widely used dataset for facial expression recognition, sourced from Kaggle. The data was combined into a single folder and randomly split into training, testing, and validation sets. The distribution of samples across these splits is train 70%, Validation 10% and Test 20%.It includes images annotated with seven basic emotions: Fear, Sad, Surprise, Happy, Neutral, Disgust, and Angry.


**Models Used:**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are effective for image-based tasks due to their ability to capture spatial features and hierarchical patterns.
Vision Transformers (ViT): ViTs employ self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies and capture global context, making them a robust choice for image recognition.
